This is a repository for programming assignments from the Programing Fundamentals 2 class.

## Magic Square
Regerates 5 magic squares, where the sum of all the rows, columns and diagonals are the same. However, this project only allows for magic squares of odd sizes between 3 and 15.

## Memory Management Simulation
Simulates how the operative system assigns blocks of memory once a program is executed. It simulates the creation of the program, destruction, and memory fragmentation. It makes use of a linked list to keep track of the individual blocks of memory being used and the ones available for allocation.
